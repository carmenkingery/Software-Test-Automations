# Software-Test-Automations

# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
The best way to ensure a project is functional and secure is through testing. Throughout 
my development of a product, I write unit tests to make sure individual pieces are working 
properly, integration tests to make sure pieces are working together properly, and at 
the end of the project I write tests to make sure everything is working as a whole. 

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User needs are the things that tell me what the customer is paying me to build. They are 
the descriptions of what the customers expect from the program. I would write the user's 
needs in the requirements document, breaking them down into specific code requirements to 
help in my designing of the program. 

# How do I approach designing software?
The first thing I would do is look at the user stories and specifications document to 
understand what it is I am building and in what conditions my application will be used. This 
helps me decide on things like what language and platform I should use. After that, I would take
the requirements document and start breaking down what kind of classes I will need and libraries 
necessary. Then its all coding from there!
